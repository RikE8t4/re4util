# RE4_Utility
A tool that rolls together all the file formats I've broken down over the years from resident evil 4. 

I have my own method for reading XML files but its very slow and messy so I'm using rapidXML at this time.
This means that there is also a dependancy on RapidXML for the time being while I exploring using XML as a data transmission format

I was also experimenting with FLTK, there are linking flags in the codeblocks project but they can be removed for the time being since I'm not executing any FLTK interfaces
