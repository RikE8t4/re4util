      "your libraries, too.\n"
      "\n"
      "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
      "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
      "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
      "this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n"
      "if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n"
      "in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n"
      "\n"
      "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n"
      "anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n"
      "These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n"
      "you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n"
      "\n"
      "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n"
      "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n"
      "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n"
      "code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n"
      "complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n"
      "with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n"
      "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n"
      "\n"
      "  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n"
      "the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n"
      "permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n"
      "\n"
      "  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain\n"

      "library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n"
      "want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n"
      "version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n"
      "the original authors' reputations.\n"
      "\n"
      "  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n"
      "patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\n"
      "software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\n"
      "transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\n"
      "we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n"
      "free use or not licensed at all.\n"

      "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n"
      "GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\n"
      "license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\n"
      "designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\n"
      "one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is\n"
      "the same as in the ordinary license.\n"
      "\n"
      "  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n"
      "they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n"
      "program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n"
      "changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n"
      "analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n"
      "a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n"
      "derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n"
      "treats it as such.\n"
      "\n"
      "  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n"
      "Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n"
      "sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n"
      "concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n"
      "\n"
      "  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n"
      "users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n"
      "libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\n"
      "permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n"
      "preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n"
      "libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\n"
      "this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\n"
      "changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\n"
      "will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n"

      "modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n"
      "\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n"
      "former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\n"
      "works together with the library.\n"

      "contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n"
      "party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n"

      "  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n"

      "\n"
      "  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n"

      "interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n"
      "and installation of the library.\n"
      "\n"
      "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n"
      "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n"
      "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n"
      "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n"
      "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n"
      "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n"
      "and what the program that uses the Library does.\n"
      "\n"
      "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n"
      "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n"

      "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n"

      "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n"
      "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n"
      "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n"
      "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
      "\n"
      "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n"

      "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n"
      "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n"
      "\n"
      "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n"
      "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n"
      "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n"
      "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n"
      "    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n"
      "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n"
      "    its purpose remains meaningful.\n"
      "\n"
      "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n"
      "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n"
      "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n"
      "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n"
      "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n"
      "    root function must still compute square roots.)\n"
      "\n"
      "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n"
      "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n"
      "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n"
      "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n"
      "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n"
      "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n"
      "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n"
      "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n"
      "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n"
      "it.\n"

      "License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n"
      "this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n"
