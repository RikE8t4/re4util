the EULA is really wordy, I think what it was saying is that I can distrbute things in the redist.txt
which only contains directx libraries so thats a joke.

since xcompress.dll is being used for utility and not as a game, it would appear fine to use, 
but i'm not sure about distributing it with my program.

I've instead included links to other sources whom have uploaded the module which you can get from.
